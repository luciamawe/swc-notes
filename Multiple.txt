Multiple files
==============

- git add 
- git commit 

- Each commit logs what change you made. You want to identify it with a hashcode to be able to revert in the future. 
- This will open Vim as the default text editor to accept changes, which you do with ":wq"
- git diff NAMEOFCOMMIT will print out what has been added or deleted from that original files
- Important: this leaves an audit trail of a mistake that was made 

- MISTAKE IN THIS LINE THAT I WANT TO DELETE.
